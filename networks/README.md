# 🌐 Summary of TCP/IP, Protocols, and PID

## What is TCP/IP?

> TCP/IP is a set of protocols responsible for sending and routing data between computers, ensuring it reaches the destination correctly.

- **IP** acts like the **ID card of the computer**, identifying both the source and destination machines.

## 📚 Fun fact

The acronym **TCP/IP** is often used to represent the entire stack of data transfer protocols, such as:

- **HTTP / HTTPS** – web data transfer
- **FTP** – file transfer
- **SMTP** – email sending
- **DNS** – domain name resolution  
  Example: When you type `www.google.com.br`, DNS translates it into an IP like `002.341.22.22`.  
  It's similar to typing a name in your contact list and retrieving the person's phone number.

## 🔗 Data protocols

- **ODBC** – Microsoft’s protocol used in tools like:
  - Python
  - Excel
  - Power BI

- **JDBC** – Oracle’s protocol, mainly used with:
  - Java-based applications

## ⚠️ Important note

> Different websites can share the **same IP address**, like Google and YouTube.

🔎 Think of the IP address as the **building address**.  
The **domain names** (like google.com and youtube.com) are like **specific apartments or floors** in that building.  
You enter the building through the IP, but the domain name tells you where exactly to go.

## 🧠 PID – Process identifier

- PID is the **unique identifier** assigned to each process/program running on your operating system.

---

## 🧪 PID vs PORT

- The **PID** is usually **dynamic** (changes each time a program runs).
- The **PORT** can be statically defined for specific services (e.g., web servers use port 80 or 443).
